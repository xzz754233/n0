    ### The MythBuster: Your Fact-Checking Engine

    "Don't eat after 8 PM." 
    "Esports players are old at 25." 
    "MSG causes headaches."

    Are these facts, or just things people say? The MythBuster doesn't guess. It scrapes academic journals, statistical databases, and expert analysis to issue a final verdict.

    #### How it works
    You enter a belief or claim. The agent:
    1.  **Traces the Origin:** Where did this idea start?
    2.  **Hunts for Data:** Ignores blogs; looks for studies, sample sizes, and P-values.
    3.  **Weighs the Consensus:** Checks what the scientific community actually agrees on.
    4.  **Issues a Verdict:** BUSTED, CONFIRMED, or PLAUSIBLE.

    #### What you get
    A structured **Verdict Dossier** with:
    * **Evidence Points:** Key findings with **direct citations** to sources.
    * **Stance:** Clear labels on whether the data supports or debunks the claim.
    * **Final Verdict:** An authoritative conclusion.
