    # Your Autonomous Biographer
    
    Stop manually scouring dozens of Wiki pages. **Event Deep Research** is an intelligent agent that acts as a dedicated research team, turning scattered web information into a coherent life story.

    ### What It Does
    * **Deep Web Crawling:** Goes beyond surface summaries to find specific life events.
    * **Smart Deduplication:** Merges conflicting sources to ensure accuracy.
    * **Structured Output:** Delivers a clean JSON timeline with exact dates, locations, and descriptions.

    ### How to Use
    Simply enter the name of a historical figure (e.g., *"Albert Einstein"* or *"J. Robert Oppenheimer"*). The agent will autonomously plan, search, read, and structure the data for you.

    ### Perfect For
    * **Content Creators:** Researching for documentaries or video scripts.
    * **Educators & Students:** Building accurate history timelines.
    * **Analysts:** Conducting background checks on public figures.
