    ### The Drama Detective: Your Gossip Investigator

    Ever open social media and see everyone fighting but have no idea why? Don't scroll through thousands of comments. The Drama Detective does the digging for you.

    #### What it does

    This agent acts as an elite entertainment journalist. It searches the web and social media, filters out the noise, and reconstructs exactly what happened, including the background, context, and latest developments.

    #### How to use it

    Simply enter a celebrity name, an influencer pair, or a specific event. 

    **Examples:** "Taylor Swift vs Kanye West", "The FTX Collapse", "OpenAI Board Drama".

    #### What you get

    A structured, chronological timeline broken down into 4 parts:
    1.  **The Context:** How it all started (the "calm before the storm").
    2.  **The Conflict:** The explosion, accusations, and leaked details.
    3.  **The Reaction:** Who took sides, PR statements, and public fallout.
    4.  **The Outcome:** Where are they now? Who got cancelled?
